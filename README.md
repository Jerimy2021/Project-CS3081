# Project-CS3081
# Virtual Planetary System

## Introduction

The Virtual Planetary System project aims to develop an interactive web application that provides users with an immersive and educational experience about the planets of the solar system. This application will utilize cutting-edge technologies to offer precise and engaging representations of the planets in a 3D environment, allowing users to explore space and access detailed information about each celestial body.

## Justification and Project Relevance

Space exploration and astronomy are areas of interest for both the general public and the academic community. Therefore, this planetarium will be a valuable tool for education and scientific outreach.

## Project Objectives

### General Objective
To develop an interactive virtual planetarium system that provides users with an educational and engaging experience about the planets of the solar system.

### Specific Objectives

1. Implement a 3D interface that accurately displays the planets, with information extracted from NASA's API.
2. Integrate navigation functionalities that allow users to explore the three-dimensional space intuitively.
3. Retrieve updated data about the planets through NASA's API and display detailed information to the user.
4. Provide a personalized experience by allowing users to select and customize the visualization of the planets.

## Project Scope

### Included System Functionalities

1. 3D interface for planet representation.
2. Intuitive navigation in three-dimensional space.
3. Detailed information retrieval about each planet through NASA's API.

### Initial Limitations

1. The project will focus exclusively on the planets of the solar system, excluding other celestial bodies.
2. The amount of detailed information about each planet will be limited to the data provided by NASA's API.

## System Requirements

### Key Functional Requirements

1. Accurate and scale representation of planets in three-dimensional space.
2. Fluid and user-controlled navigation capabilities.
3. Integration with NASA's API to obtain planet data.
4. Intuitive user interface to access detailed information about each planet.
5. Real-time movement of planets to simulate their orbit around a star.
6. Time accelerator to display planet movement at a faster speed.

### Additional Functional Requirements

1. Tracing of the rotation axis of planets to display their inclination.
2. Representation of the natural satellites of the planets.
3. Visualization of nearby stars and their relative position to the planets.
4. Visualization of a star with planets in orbit so that the movement of the planets around the star can be seen.
